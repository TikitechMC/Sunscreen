# Sunscreen
Sunscreen is a (very) WIP GUI library, built with ultimate platform compatability in mind. It removes the limitations of chest GUIs, meaning you can place any element anywhere! Input is also ahead of chest GUIs, with inputs ranging from clicking and hovering to text input, anywhere on the screen!

> [!WARNING]  
> This library/plugin won't run without the default assets, which are kept out from source on purpose. Contact ``@combimagnetron`` on Discord for a possible test run with assets.

- Native support for text input
- Hover and click animations
